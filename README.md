# Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict the sales of Big Mart stores using historical sales data. The analysis and model building are performed using Python with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Project Overview
- **Data Manipulation**: Cleaned and transformed the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations of the data.
- **Model Building**: Implemented linear regression models using Scikit-learn to predict sales.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generated plots to understand data distribution and relationships.
3. **Model Training**: Trained linear regression models and evaluated their performance.

## Repository Contents
- **Big-Mart Sales Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis and model building process.
- **Big Mart Sales.csv**: Source data for the analysis.

Feel free to explore the notebook and provide any feedback or suggestions!
